# Developing a Neural Network Regression Model

## AIM:

To develop a neural network regression model for the given dataset.

## THEORY:

The given problem is a **regression problem**, where the objective is to predict a continuous target variable (weight) based on an input feature (height). Unlike classification, which predicts discrete categories, regression aims to find a relationship between input variables and continuous output values.

A **neural network regression model** is an artificial neural network that maps input data to continuous output. It consists of:

* **Input layer:** Receives the feature(s) (in this case, height).
* **Hidden layers:** Contain neurons that perform transformations using weighted connections, activation functions (like ReLU), and bias terms to learn complex, non-linear relationships.
* **Output layer:** Produces a continuous value (predicted weight).

### Key Concepts:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   * The dataset is split into **training** and **testing** sets to train and evaluate the model.
   * **MinMaxScaler** is applied to scale features between 0 and 1, ensuring stable training and faster convergence.

2. **Neural Network Model:**

   * Multiple fully connected (dense) layers are used.
   * **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** activation introduces non-linearity, enabling the model to learn complex patterns.
   * The final layer has a single neuron (since the output is one continuous value).

3. **Loss Function:**

   * **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is used as the loss function to measure the difference between actual and predicted weights.
   * Lower MSE indicates better performance.

4. **Optimizer:**

   * **RMSProp** optimizer is applied to update weights and minimize loss during backpropagation.

5. **Training Process:**

   * Forward pass computes predictions.
   * Backward pass updates weights based on the gradient of the loss function.
   * Training continues for multiple epochs until the model converges.

6. **Model Evaluation:**

   * The modelâ€™s performance is tested on unseen data (test set).
   * A **loss vs. epoch plot** shows how the model improves over time.
   * The trained model can also predict new, unseen inputs.
